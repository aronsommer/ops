               <b>COMPOSE (2022)</b> is an open edition of unique poetry broadsides based on an interactive “pose poem” by <b>Sasha Stiles and Nathaniel Stern</b>, in collaboration with playrecordmint, for the exhibition DYOR at Kunsthalle Zürich. The series utilizes a combination of interactive and minting technology to leverage blockchain as a bespoke printing press, nodding to the historical advent of moveable type and printed literature while looking ahead to the future of authorship, readership and publishing.</b> </b> 
               At its center is a poem written by Technelegy – Stiles’ AI-powered alter ego, a custom text generator rooted in GPT-3 and fine-tuned on her own writing and reference materials. Visitors are invited to engage with words on screen via code written by Stern, resulting in a uniquely personal, one of a kind interpretation of the poem that draws visual and conceptual elements from both Stiles’ and Stern’s work.<br><br><br>

                <b>Haystacks (2022)</b> is an open edition of still images from a constantly evolving, interactive artwork by <b>Leander Herzog</b> in collaboration with playrecordmint for the exhibition DYOR at Kunsthalle Zürich. Data from a computer vision system is drawn onto the digital canvas, generating a dense composition that reflects the patterns of visitors’ movements. Haystacks creates a visual manifestation of the audience - the bodies - that pass physically in front of the interactive work. The marks then dissolve into a painterly surface texture enabled by the medium’s pixellation. The direct transfer of motion to marks on a surface is inspired by Rudolf Stingel’s works with metallic Celotex insulation panels: by inviting viewers to make their own marks on the surfaces, he removes artistic privilege from the individual and hands it over to the collective.<br><br><br>
